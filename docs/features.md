# Movie Challenge Features

## Premise
Create a web app, android app, etc. That would make use of the IMDb Open api service: [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/)

## Mandatory Features
The application **must** contain the following functionality:
+ Users can search by movie name
  - Returns at minimum the following:
    * Title
    * Year
    * Rated
    * Released
    * Runtime
    * Genre
    * Directory
+ Users can select movies and add to watchlist (permanent or temporary)
+ Additional page aggregating statistics in the watch list for example:
  - Average runtime
  - Number of genres
  - Rank of Favorite Directors

## Optional Features in order
Below is a list of additional functionality I intend to include in the application ordered by importance:
1. Search by different categories: Genre, Directors, Actors/actresses
2. Movie plot/poster in movie details
3. Recommended movies based of aggregated stats
4. Responsive webpage
5. Light/night option
6. Sharelist
