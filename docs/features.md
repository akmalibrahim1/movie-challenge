# Movie Challenge Features

## Premise
Create a web app, android app, etc. That would make use of the IMDb Open api service: [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/)

## Mandatory Features
The application **must** contain the following functionality:
+ Users can search by movie name
  - Returns at minimum the following:
    * <strike>Title</strike>
    * <strike>Year</strike>
    * <strike>Rated</strike>
    * <strike>Released</strike>
    * <strike>Runtime</strike>
    * <strike>Genre</strike>
    * <strike>Director</strike>
+ Users can select movies and add to watchlist (permanent or temporary)
+ Additional page aggregating statistics in the watch list for example:
  - Average runtime
  - Number of genres
  - Rank of Favorite Directors

## Optional Features in order
Below is a list of additional functionality I intend to include in the application ordered by importance:
1. <strike>Search by different categories: Genre, Directors, Actors/actresses</strike>**Not possible with API**
2. <strike>Movie plot/poster in movie details</strike> **✔**
3. <strike>Recommended movies based of aggregated stats</strike>**Not possible with API**
